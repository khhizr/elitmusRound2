Then open the backend folder in any editor you want or just open the terminal on your pc.
You then have to install express and mongoose with the help of npm. The command for that is npm install "dependency-name"

Now you can start the backend server with command node app.js

Now you can open the frontend folder
To run the extension you have to enable developer settings by going to extension settings page in the chrome browser
